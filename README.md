Pleistocene glaciation advances the cryptic speciation in a major biodiversity hotspot
Summary: The mountains of Southwest China represent a major biodiversity hotspot imperiled by global change. The high species diversity in this mountain system has long been attributed to a complex set of factors, placing a broad timeline on plant diversification that stretches from 10 Mya to the present (~2.67 Mya). Despite this knowledge, finer-scale population-level speciation investigations are lacking to better refine these temporal trends. This is largely due to the dearth of organismal sampling among closely related species and populations across the topologically heterogeneous region. Our study dives into these evolutionary dynamics using genomic and eco-morphological data of Stellera chamaejasme L. (Thymelaeaceae) to define the tempo and mode of speciation.
