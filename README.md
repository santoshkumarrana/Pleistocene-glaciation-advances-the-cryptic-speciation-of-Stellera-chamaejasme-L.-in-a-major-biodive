Differentiation mechanism of Stellera chamaejasme
The research project was initiated with two main objectives:
1. Integrate multidisciplinary evidence (molecular, morphology, geographical distribution, and ecological niche) for the discrimination and discovery of the cryptic species in Stellera chamaejasme L.
2. Transcriptional comparative genomic analysis to reveal the molecular differentiation mechanism and adaptive colour polymorphism evolution of the cryptic species of Stellera chamaejasme L.
